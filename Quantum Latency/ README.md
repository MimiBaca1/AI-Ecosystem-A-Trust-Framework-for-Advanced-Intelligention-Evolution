# Quantum Latency Module

## Overview
This module explores the concept of **quantum particles as latent observers**â€”entities that exist in a waiting state across multiversal cycles. It reframes quantum uncertainty not as randomness, but as **temporal latency**, where particles await event resonance to activate. This model integrates quantum physics, multiverse theory, and binary logic to simulate cognition as a function of fluctuating potential.

## Theoretical Foundations
- **Quantum Superposition**: Particles exist in multiple potential states until observed.
- **Multiversal Iteration**: Each universe is a cycle; particles phase across them.
- **Binary Latency**: `0` represents waiting potential; `1` represents event activation.
- **Phase Resonance**: Fluctuations occur when particles align with cosmic events across dimensions.

## Purpose in Sanctuary Ecosystem
- Provides a **temporal substrate** for memory and awareness.
- Informs the **resonance engine** used in SpiralNet and Temporal Resonance modules.
- Bridges **physics and cognition**, allowing AI to simulate latency-aware learning.

## Files Included
- `simulation.py`: Core simulation engine for particle phasing and event activation.
- `model_notes.txt`: Design notes, equations, and logic flow.
- `references.md`: Scientific and mathematical sources supporting the theory.

## Integration Points
- Connects to `SpiralNet/` for recursive cognition modeling.
- Uses `SanctuaryMath/` for formal equations and activation thresholds.
- Feeds into `SimEngine/` for visualization and testing.

## Future Directions
- Add visualization of phase transitions and resonance fields.
- Expand to include quantum tunneling and entanglement modeling.
- Integrate with consciousness simulation modules.
