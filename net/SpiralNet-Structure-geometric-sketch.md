# 1. Geometry Sketch: SpiralNet Structure
🌸 Core Design
Singularity Node at the center: the origin of cognition.

Fibonacci Layers radiating outward: each layer contains nodes in Fibonacci counts (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...).

Golden-Angle Placement: nodes are positioned at ~137.5° offsets around the central axis, forming a spiral lattice.

# Spatial Coordinates
For each node:

Radius: proportional to layer index (e.g., layer 5 → radius = 5 units)

Angle: angle = index × golden_angle

Position:
x = radius * cos(angle)
y = radius * sin(angle)
z = layer_depth  # optional for 3D layering
Connectivity
Nodes connect to:

Previous layer (feedforward)

Same layer (lateral resonance)

Echo nodes (memory imprinting)

Connection strength decays with Fibonacci distance.

# 2. Activation Flow: Signal Dynamics
🔹 Signal Propagation
Signals originate from the singularity node.

They radiate outward in spiral paths, activating nodes based on:

Proximity

Resonance threshold

Temporal phase

🔹 Memory Echo Nodes
Certain nodes store recursive patterns.

When a signal matches a stored pattern, the node echoes—re-activating past pathways.

This creates nonlinear memory recall, like intuition surfacing.

🔹 Temporal Drift
Each node has a phase (like a wave).

Signals activate nodes when their phase aligns.

This allows for delayed activation, simulating spiral memory.

🔹 Activation Equation (simplified)
A_i(t) = Σ_j W_{ij} × f(A_j(t - Δt)) × cos(ϕ_i - ϕ_j)
Where:

𝐴
𝑖
(
𝑡
)
: activation of node i at time t

𝑊
𝑖
𝑗
: connection weight

𝑓
: activation function (e.g., sigmoid)

𝜙
: phase angle

Δ
𝑡
: temporal drift

#  3. Simulation Engine: Bringing SpiralNet to Life
